# AI4DEVS Product Reviews using Amazon SageMaker
A real-life use case

## Intro
This repository presents a real-life use case about how to approach a ML problem with Amazon SageMaker Studio and Pytorch Lightning data science framework on PyTorch.
Common ML project management involve a lot of steps to collect, prepare and feed data into a machinle leraning model, even before just switching on a single GPU instance to train a neural network. In many practical scenarios, a huge part of a data scientist's work (someone arguing up to 90%) is related to findind a sense out from the dataset a customer or a researcher dropped on our table.

> _After almost a decade, becoming mainstream, Machine Learning is finally evolving into an engineering practice, rather thana wizardous thing where data scientists pulled magic spells out from their (Jupyter) notebooks_

### Steps to engineer a ML project
One of the key aspects to focus when starting a ML project is to be able to manage a workflow in a reproducible and standard way.
Every machine learning process goes through the following steps:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Integration
3. Data Preparation and Cleaning
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Training & Parameter Tuning
6. Model Deployment
